    "From our house made batter and sauces, straight to the grill and to your table, we pride ourselves in providing the best dining experience a restaurant can offer. Our menu consists of wings, drumsticks, whole chicken, and much more. Start your meal off with our popular appetizers like our honey-glazed rice cakes or hot waffle fries and wash it all down with our carefully selected draft beer selection, including local craft brews.
