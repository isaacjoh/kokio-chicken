Our menu consists of wings, drumsticks, whole chicken, and much more. Start your meal off with our popular appetizers like our honey-glazed rice cakes or hot waffle fries and wash it all down with our carefully selected draft beer selection, including local craft brews. Our tasty selection of USDA-approved sauces fits all taste buds from Korean-inspired to traditional buffalo - don't forget to use our famous green sauce to kick the flavor up a notch!
